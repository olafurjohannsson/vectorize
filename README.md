# Vectorize

WIP

A solution to create embeddings using Minilm-l6-v2, although the archtecture does
support all BERT models.

Does not use ONNX, an attempt at creating a small WASM compatible crate to use either

In browser with WASM

On other devices with or without WASM

Takes extremely heavy inspiration from transformers.js and transformers Python library from Huggingface
